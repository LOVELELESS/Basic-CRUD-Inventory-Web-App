# Basic-CRUD-Inventory-Web-App
A basic web-application inventory that I created using vanilla JS, HTML and CSS just for fun! :) 

The inventory class takes in:
1. Name
2. Quantity
3. Type (which can be selected from Laptop,Desktop,Tablet,Mobile)
and assigns a unique ID to each item

It can update and remove an item based on its name and ID.

It can also render in HTML the realtime inventory information(ID,name,qty,type) of each item.
