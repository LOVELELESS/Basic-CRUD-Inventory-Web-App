# Basic-CRUD-Inventory-Web-App
A basic web-application inventory that I created using vanilla JS, HTML and CSS just for fun! :)
I used Node.js Webpack for bundling.


Details

The inventory class takes in:
1. Name
2. Quantity
3. Type (which can be selected from Laptop,Desktop,Tablet,Mobile)
and assigns a unique ID to each item

It can update and remove an item based on its name and ID.

It can also render in HTML the realtime inventory information(ID,name,qty,type) of each item.


Persistent Data

I used the localstorage functionality in the window to enable persistent data upon reloading of the page.


How to use

In the terminal, type 'npm run start' to start the local live-server. Have fun with Ray's inventory!
